              <h2>Yosmite Falls</h2>
              <p>Yosemite is home to countless waterfalls. The best time to see waterfalls is during spring, when most of the snowmelt occurs.
                   Peak runoff typically occurs in May or June, with some waterfalls (including Yosemite Falls) often only a trickle or completely dry by August.
                    Storms in late fall rejuvenate some of the waterfalls and all of them accumulate frost along their edges many nights during the winter.

              <h2>Half Dome</h2>
              <p>Half Dome, the iconic slab of granite in Yosemite Nationa Park that you know from your pre-loaded Mac desktop screensaver.
                   It is one of the most easily recognizable things in all of California, up there with even the Golden Gate Bridge.
                   If you havenâ€™t seen it in real life then be sure to add it to your list
               </p>

              <a name="El Captain"></a>
              <h2>El Captain</h2>
              <p>In Yosemite Valley, El Capitan Meadow provides a view straight up El Capitan and a great view of Cathedral Rocks, as well.
                   Located along one-way Northside Drive, it is best to stop here on your way out of Yosemite Valley.
                </p>

          <section>
              <a name="Tunnel view"></a>
              <h2>Tunnel view</h2>
              <p>Tunnel View provides one of the most famous views of Yosemite Valley. From here you can see El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall rising from Yosemite Valley,
                   with Half Dome in the background. This viewpoint is at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel along the Wawona Road

          <section>
              <a name="Glacier Point"></a>
              <h2>Glacier Point</h2>
              <p>The most famous viewpoint and the most unobstructed, as you are practically right across from Half Dome itself.
                  The valley that is between you provides a great foreground for photos as it is incredibly beautiful and very vast.
                  This is the best spot for stargazing as you can see the outline of Half Dome below the stars. It is also a really popular sunset spot where you can get great photos of the last light on top of Half Dome.
                  Glacier Point, some would say, is the most spectacular viewpoint anywhere. Most people agree that its views of the high country and breathtaking views of Yosemite Valley, including Half Dome and three waterfalls,
                   are the most spectacular in the park.
